# CVATScripts
This repository contains helpful scripts for CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool).
#CVATLinkGenerator is a helpful script that lets you generate URLs for provided image names. This is specially helpful when you are pre-processing and find irregularities in your exported dataset and would like to refer to the images in the CVAT or advise the labelling team to review the specific images. CVAT by default doesn't provide this functionality.
